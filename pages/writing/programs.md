open the command panel with `CMD + Shift + P`

# Git handling

### Example using github

1. Create a repository on github.com. You must be logged on to create a repository on the website. In the free account version you can only create public repositories (everbody can access your data). To enable private repositories, a payed account is necessary.

2. Create an empty project folder locally on your computer. E.g.:
```
mkdir /User/martin/knowledge 
```

3. Open Visual Studio Code and open your project folder (File -> Open, or `CMD + O`)

4. Switch to the internal console (`ctrl + Shift + Â´`) and enter
```
git clone URL_TO_YOUR_REPOSITORY
```
5. If you want to try it out with the sample repository from the publication try
```
git clone https://github.com/MartinEls/knowledge.git
```
TODO: put sample console output here.
